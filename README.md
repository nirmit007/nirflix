# 🎬 Nirflix

**Nirflix** is a full-stack streaming web app inspired by Netflix. It allows media upload, online streaming, subtitle/audio switching, and more — all built from scratch as a learning journey in full-stack development.

This is a personal project aimed at learning full-stack development, building a resume-worthy app, and having fun creating something meaningful (and maybe a little romantic ❤️).
